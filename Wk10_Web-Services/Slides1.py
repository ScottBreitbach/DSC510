'''API Example Code'''

import requests

url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

# This is the query string that we're going to submit to the URL.
# Notice that this is a dictionary with key value pairs.
querystring = {"zip":"68522",
               "APPID":"d5751b1a9e2e4b2b8c7983646072da8b"}
# This is used to submit any headers we need for the HTTP Request.
# Notice that the headers are a dictionary.
headers = {'cache-control':'no-cache'}

# This is where the real magic occurs. We're going to submit all of our data to the URL in order to get
# data back in the form of JSON data. Keep in mind that the data you get back depends on the webservice
# that you interact with
response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
